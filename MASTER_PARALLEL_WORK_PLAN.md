## ⚡ CLAUDE ELITE EXECUTION PROTOCOL (CEEP)

To eliminate technical debt and prevent regressions, all work operates under the **Claude Elite Protocol**:

1.  **Architectural Dominance (Claude Team):**
    *   Defines all security guards, database relations, and API signatures.
    *   Reviews every line of code against the **Zero-Any Policy**.
    *   Enforces the **3-Tier Verification** (Build -> Test -> Runtime).

2.  **High-Strength Implementation:**
    *   Execution must adhere to the **5-Level Definition of Done**.
    *   No placeholder comments or "silent data loss" bugs allowed.
    *   Automatic rejection of any code that breaks compilation or has unverified imports.
