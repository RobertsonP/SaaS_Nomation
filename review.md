All work is complete! ✅



&nbsp; Here's what will happen when you run restart.bat:



&nbsp; What You'll See:



&nbsp; 1. DashboardPage Fix 🎯

&nbsp; - Before: Crashed with "Cannot access 'stats' before initialization" error after login

&nbsp; - After: Dashboard loads smoothly with statistics displayed correctly

&nbsp; - Test: Login and navigate to dashboard - no crash!



&nbsp; 2. Docker DATABASE\_URL Fix 🐳

&nbsp; - Before: DATABASE\_URL hardcoded in docker-compose.yml

&nbsp; - After: Now supports .env file override with ${DATABASE\_URL:-default} pattern

&nbsp; - Test: Docker containers restart with proper database connection



&nbsp; 3. GEMINI Protocol Upgrades 📚

&nbsp; - These are documentation improvements (GEMINI.PARTNER.md and GEMINI.FULL-PARTNER.md)

&nbsp; - No runtime changes, but future GEMINI work will follow enhanced protocols
