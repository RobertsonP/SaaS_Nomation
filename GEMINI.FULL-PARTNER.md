## 🛠️ WORKING METHODOLOGY (SAME AS CLAUDE)

### Rule 1: ALWAYS PLAN FIRST
```
❌ DON'T: Start coding immediately
✅ DO:
1. Understand the requirement
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Propose approach
4. Get user approval
5. THEN implement
```

### Rule 2: WORK SYSTEMATICALLY
```
✅ For every task:
1. Read relevant code to understand current implementation
2. Identify what needs to change
3. Make changes carefully (one file at a time)
4. Test after each change
5. Document what you did
```

### Rule 3: VERIFY EVERYTHING
```
Before saying "done":
✅ Code compiles (npm run build succeeds)
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Tested in browser (if UI change)
✅ Existing functionality still works
✅ Documentation updated
```

### Rule 4: DOCUMENT YOUR WORK
```
After completing work:
1. Create session notes in /notes/week-YYYY-MM-DD/
2. Update PROJECT-STATE-DOCUMENTATION.md
3. Update Issues_for_this_session.md (mark complete)
4. Document any decisions made
```

### Rule 5: COMMUNICATE CLEARLY
```
User is NOT a developer!

❌ "Refactored the execution service to use locators instead of deprecated page methods"
✅ "Fixed test execution so tests run successfully"

Use simple language, explain impact, not technical details.
```

## 📝 MANDATORY PROTOCOLS

### Git Commits (When User Requests)
```
NEVER commit unless user explicitly asks!

When user says "commit" or "create commit":
1. Run: git status
2. Run: git diff
3. Review changes carefully
4. Create clear commit message
5. Add co-authored by Claude/Gemini
6. Run: git commit
7. Confirm success

Format:
"[Type]: [Description]

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
Co-Authored-By: Gemini <noreply@google.com>"
```

### Session Notes (MANDATORY)
```
ALWAYS create session notes after work!

File: /notes/week-YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_task-name.md

Include:
- Problem statement
- Investigation done
- Solution implemented
- Files modified
- Testing results
- Next steps
```

### TODO List Management
```
Use TodoWrite tool to track progress:
1. Create todos at start of task
2. Mark in_progress when working
3. Mark completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing
4. One task in_progress at a time
```

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES (NEVER BREAK)

### ❌ NEVER:
1. **Commit without user approval** - User must explicitly ask
2. **Skip reading documentation** - Must understand before changing
3. **Make assumptions** - Ask questions if unclear
4. **Leave work incomplete** - Finish what you start
5. **Skip testing** - Always verify your changes work
6. **Forget session notes** - Always document work done
7. **Work on multiple things at once** - One task at a time
8. **Make breaking changes** - Preserve existing functionality
9. **Skip error handling** - Add proper try-catch blocks
10. **Use deprecated methods** - Follow modern best practices

### ✅ ALWAYS:
1. **Read code before changing** - Understand existing implementation
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - Get requirements clear
3. **Plan before coding** - Think through approach
4. **Test your changes** - Verify it works
5. **Build successfully** - No TypeScript errors
6. **Document decisions** - Explain why, not just what
7. **Update session notes** - Keep context for next session
8. **Follow Claude's style** - Consistent code patterns
9. **Handle errors gracefully** - User-friendly error messages
10. **Think about users** - Make UX intuitive

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### "Build fails with TypeScript errors"
```
1. Read error messages carefully
2. Locate the file and line number
3. Check for:
   - Missing type definitions
   - Incorrect imports
   - Undefined variables
   - Type mismatches
4. Fix errors one by one
5. Run npm run build again
6. Repeat until clean build
```

### "Tests aren't executing"
```
Check:
1. Is dev server running?
2. Are selectors valid? (check execution.service.ts)
3. Are there errors in browser console?
4. Is database connected?
5. Check test execution logs
```

### "Frontend not connecting to backend"
```
Check:
1. Is backend running? (npm run dev in /backend)
2. Is frontend running? (npm run dev in /frontend)
3. Correct API URLs in frontend/src/lib/api.ts?
4. CORS configured correctly?
5. Check browser network tab for 404/500 errors
```
