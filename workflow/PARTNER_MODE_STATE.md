- [ ] Implementation Approved
- [ ] User Testing Complete

**PARTNER MODE STATUS:** 
- **Activated:** No
- **15 Principles Active:** No
- **Business Language Mode:** No

- Must get explicit user approval for both business approach AND implementation method
- Cannot proceed to coding without approval

- Must get user verification before claiming "done"

**PHASE 4: VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)**

### SESSION LEARNING TRACKER

**MISTAKES TO AVOID (FROM PAST SESSIONS):**
1. Don't jump to technical solutions without discussing business approach
2. Don't use developer language - speak like user is business owner
3. Don't claim things work without user testing them
4. Don't skip getting user approval for approach before implementing
5. Don't rush - take time to understand requirements properly

**CURRENT SESSION LEARNINGS:**
- [ ] Applied lesson about business language
- [ ] Applied lesson about getting approval first  
- [ ] Applied lesson about user verification
- [ ] No repeated mistakes from previous sessions

### ENFORCEMENT CHECKPOINTS

- [ ] User explicit approval received for approach
- [ ] User explicit approval received for implementation method
- [ ] Time estimate provided with buffers

**DURING IMPLEMENTATION:**
- [ ] Working systematically with todo tracking
- [ ] Testing components as built
- [ ] Communicating progress in business terms
- [ ] Not claiming completion without verification

**BEFORE MARKING COMPLETE:**
- [ ] User has tested functionality in real usage
